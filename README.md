## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD all provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset since the PR (>|t|) values are all above 0.05. The slope is not considered to be zero since our p-value in our analysis is smaller than out assumed significance level of .05%. The linear modal overall doesn't effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes since 3 of the 5 factors provide non-random variance and the slope is not zero.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Overall when it comes to all vehicles and for vehicles in Lots 1 and 2, the variance of the suspension coils meet the design specifications of under 100 pounds per square inch. The one lot which does not meet the design specifications is Lot 3, where the variance is just over 170 pounds per square inch.
